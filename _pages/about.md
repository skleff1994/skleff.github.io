I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the [Inria Centre at the University of Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-bordeaux) in the [AUCTUS](https://auctus-team.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) team, since September 2024. My research interests include model predictive control, physical interaction control and human–robot collaboration. Currently, I am working on tactile sensing and physical human-robot collaboration.

I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from New York University in May 2024, where I was co-advised by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) (NYU) and [Nicolas Mansard](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/index.php/Members/NicolasMansard) (LAAS-CNRS). From 2020 to 2022, I conducted part of my doctoral research on-site at LAAS-CNRS in the [Gepetto Team](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/). I received the "Diplôme d'Ingénieur" (equiv. M.S. degree) in robotics from [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) and an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in March 2019. I was an intern in the [Autonomous Motion](https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) research group in 2015 where I worked on stable gait generation for bipedal walking. I also worked as a research engineer at [UTC - Renault's joint lab](https://www.hds.utc.fr/en/partnerships/laboratoire-commun-sivalab.html) in 2019 on the accurate localization of autonomous cars.

Research
======

My doctoral research, conducted jointly at the [Machines in Motion Laboratory](https://wp.nyu.edu/machinesinmotion/) and [LAAS-CNRS](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/) focused on leveraging force sensing in model-predictive control for robotic motion generation, and more generally developing tools for

Software
======
I am one of the main developers and managers of the [mim_solvers](https://github.com/machines-in-motion/mim_solvers) library with [Armand Jordana](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zLICCioAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Avadesh Meduri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DsGVfRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), an efficient numerical optimization solver tailored for nonlinear Model-Predictive Control, compatible with the [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl) library.

I also contributed to the development and democratization of nonlinear MPC in the robotics community through the [croco_mpc_utils](https://github.com/machines-in-motion/croco_mpc_utils) plugin, which enables to quickly prototype Optimal Control Problems in Crocoddyl through templated configuration files and to visualize their solutions.

I also contributed to the [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl) library by implementing constrained forward dynamics derivatives in moving coordinates.
